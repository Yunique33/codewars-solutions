## Description
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and every string is a perfectly valid representation of an integral number.

# My Solution
```ruby
def string_to_number(s)
  s.to_i
end
```
