# [Basic variable assignment](https://www.codewars.com/kata/50ee6b0bdeab583673000025)

## Description
This code should store `"codewa.rs"` as a variable called `name` but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

```ruby
a == "code"
b == "wa.rs"
name == a + b
```

## My Solution
```ruby
a = "code"
b = "wa.rs"
name = a + b
```
